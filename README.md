# DAW Project: Modeling McDonald's Dataset Using Logistic Regression

This project aims to introduce some fundamental steps on how to build machine learning model using logistic regression. It is inspired by another project presented in Machine Learning course that uses classification algorithms to make prediction. 

The app is made entirely using Dash.

## Getting Started

Make sure to download the entire directory named `daw_project`.

### Prerequisites

The following packages need to be imported in your environment. These include:

- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn.linear_model
- sklearn.model_selection
- time


### Installing

To run the app, do the following:

1. Open a Terminal or File explorer on Linux platform, i.e., Ubuntu.
1. On  the Terminal, navigate to the directory where `daw_project` is location. Make sure that the directory has been decompressed if downloaded as ZIP file. 
1. On  the Terminal, navigate to the directory path `/daw_project/server`.
1. Type `python app.py`.
1. While the app is running on Terminal, open a web browser.
1. Launch `http://127.0.0.1:8090` on the web browser URL.

## Running the tests

The app is created using Flask Python, Plotly Javascript, and Bootstrap CSS. Basic testings were done but not documented. Feel free to investigate and kindly email the creators [lstamaria@aim.edu](lstamaria@aim.edu) and  [csoriano@aim.edu](csoriano@aim.edu) should there be bug or problem in running the app. 

### Coding style tests

Coding style is done using automatically on Jupyter Notebook extension `autopep8`.

## Deployment

This app is deployed via [Gitlab](git@gitlab.datascience.aim.edu:lstamaria/daw_project.git).

## Built With

* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - A microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions
* [Plotly](https://plot.ly/javascript/) - A high-level, declarative charting library. plotly.js ships with 20 chart types, including 3D charts, statistical graphs, and SVG maps
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - An open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS

## Contributing

## Versioning

No formal versioning was used in the development of this app.
